  A set of rules and protocols that allows software applications to communicate with each other. The TMDB API enables developers to access movie, TV show, and actor data programmatically.

- Endpoint
  A specific URL within an API that represents a resource or functionality. For example, /movie/popular is an endpoint that returns a list of popular movies.

- Request
  A call made to an API endpoint to retrieve or manipulate data. Requests typically include an HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST) and parameters.

- Response
  The data returned by the API after processing a request. Responses are usually in JSON format and include the requested data or an error message.
