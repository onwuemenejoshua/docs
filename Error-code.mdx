This page provides a comprehensive guide to the most common status codes, their meanings, and how to resolve them.

## Common status code

- 200 OK

  - Meaning: The request was successful, and the server returned the requested data.

  - Resolution: No action needed. Your request was processed successfully.

- 400 Bad Request

  - Meaning: The request was invalid or malformed. This could be due to missing or incorrect parameters.

  - Resolution:

    - Check the request URL and ensure all required parameters are included.

    - Verify that the parameter values are valid (e.g., correct data types).

    - Review the API documentation for the specific endpoint youâ€™re using.

- 401 Unauthorized

  - Meaning: The request lacks valid authentication credentials. This usually occurs when your_bearer_token is missing, invalid, or expired.

  - Resolution:

    - Ensure your_bearer_token is included in the request (either as a query parameter or in the header).

    - Verify that your_bearer_token is correct and hasnâ€™t expired.

    - If using a session-based endpoint, ensure your session_id is valid.

- 403 Forbidden

  - Meaning: The server understood the request but refuses to authorize it. This could be due to insufficient permissions or rate limits being exceeded.

  - Resolution:

    - Check if your_bearer_token has the necessary permissions for the requested endpoint.

    - Ensure youâ€™re not exceeding the API rate limits. Wait a few moments before making additional requests.

    - If using a session-based endpoint, ensure your session_id is valid and has the required permissions.

* 404 Not Found

  - Meaning: The requested resource (e.g., movie, TV show, or account) could not be found.

  - Resolution:

    - Verify that the resource ID or parameter in the request URL is correct.

    - Ensure the resource exists in the TMDb database.

    - Double-check the endpoint URL for typos or errors.

* 429 Too Many Requests

  - Meaning: Youâ€™ve exceeded the API rate limits. TMDb imposes limits on the number of requests you can make within a specific time frame.

  - Resolution:

    - Wait a few moments before making additional requests.

    - Implement rate limiting in your application to avoid exceeding the limits.

    - Consider upgrading to a higher API tier if you require more requests.

* 500 Internal Server Error

  - Meaning: The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.

  - Resolution:

    - Retry the request after a few moments. This could be a temporary issue on the server side.

    - If the issue persists, check the TMDb API [status page](/Error-code) or contact [TMDb support](https://www.themoviedb.org/about/get-in-touch/).

## How to Handle Errors in Your Application

- Check the Status Code: Always inspect the HTTP status code returned by the API to determine the type of error.

- Read the Error Message: The API response usually includes a status_message field with details about the error. Use this information to debug the issue.

- If you see errors like 429, 500, or 503, try the request again after waiting a bit, and wait longer if it fails again."

- Validate Inputs: Ensure all request parameters are valid and meet the APIâ€™s requirements before making a request.

- Monitor Rate Limits: Keep track of your API usage to avoid exceeding rate limits.

## Rate Limit

<Note>
  As of December 16, 2019, we have disabled the original API rate limiting (40
  requests every 10 seconds.) If you have any questions about this, please head
  over to [our API support
  forum](https://www.themoviedb.org/talk/category/5047958519c29526b50017d6).
</Note>

While our legacy rate limits have been disabled for some time, we do still have some upper limits to help mitigate needlessly high bulk scraping. They sit somewhere in the 50 requests per second range. This limit could change at any time so be respectful of the service we have built and respect the **429** if you receive one.
