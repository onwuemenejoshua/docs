Our **TMDb API** uses the Bearer Token to interact with our API. Here's how get the bearer token.

<Note>
  The API key is not functional at the moment, hence you are to work with the
  Read accces token (Bearer token)
</Note>

1. Create a TMDb account

Before you can obtain your bearer token, you need to have a TMDb account. If you donâ€™t already have one, follow these steps:

- Go to [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
