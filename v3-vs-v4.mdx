TMDB offers two main versions of its API: v3 and v4

## TMDB API v3

The v3 API is the most widely used version of TMDB's API. It provides access to a vast amount of data, including movies, TV shows, actors, images, videos, and user-generated content. The v3 API is RESTful and uses JSON as its data format.

### Key Features

- Movie Data: Access details such as title, release date, runtime, genres, ratings, and more.

- TV Show Data: Retrieve information about TV shows, including episodes, seasons, and cast.

- People Data: Get details about actors, directors, and other crew members.

- Search Functionality: Search for movies, TV shows, and people.

- Images and Videos: Access posters, backdrops, trailers, and clips.

- User Authentication: Supports user authentication for managing favorites, watchlists, and ratings.

- Pagination: Supports pagination for large datasets.

- Rate Limiting: API requests are rate-limited to ensure fair Usage

### Example Endpoint

Get Movie Details:

```
GET https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/{movie_id}?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY
```

## TMDB API v4

The v4 API is a newer version of TMDB's API, designed to provide a more streamlined and secure experience. It introduces significant changes, including a new authentication method and improved security features. Unlike v3, v4 uses Bearer Token authentication instead of an API key.

### Key Features

- Enhanced Security: Improved security measures to protect user data.

- Backward Compatibility: Works alongside v3, allowing developers to transition gradually.

- Limited Endpoints: As of now, v4 has fewer endpoints compared to v3, focusing primarily on authentication and user-related operations.

### Example Endpoint

Get Account Details:

```
GET https://api.themoviedb.org/4/account?api_key=YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN
```

<Note>Requires a valid Bearer Token in the request header.</Note>

## Which Version Should You Use?

- Use v3 if you need access to a wide range of data, such as movie details, TV show information, and search functionality. It is the most feature-rich and widely supported version.

- Use v4 if you are focusing on user authentication or need enhanced security features. However, note that v4 currently has limited functionality compared to v3.
