The TMDB API is continuously evolving to improve functionality, add new features, and fix issues. This page documents changes to the API, including new features, deprecated endpoints, and breaking changes. It also explains how versioning works and how you can access older versions of the API.

## Versioning

The TMDB API uses semantic versioning to manage changes. The version number is included in the API endpoint URL (e.g., /3/movie/popular). Hereâ€™s how versioning works:

- Major Version (e.g., 3 in /3/): Indicates breaking changes that may require updates to your application.

- Minor Version (e.g., 3.1): Indicates new features or improvements that are backward-compatible.

- Patch Version (e.g., 3.1.2): Indicates bug fixes or minor updates that do not affect functionality.

### Accessing Older Versions

Older versions of the API are not maintained or supported. Once a new version is released, all users are encouraged to migrate to the latest version. If you rely on deprecated features, plan to update your integration as soon as possible.
